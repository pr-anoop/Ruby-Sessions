On non-Posix operating systems, there may be only the ability to make a file read-only or read-write. In this case, the remaining permission bits will be synthesized to resemble typical values. For instance, on Windows NT the default permission bits are ZZZZ, which means read/write for owner, read-only for all others. The only change that can be made is to make the file read-only, which is reported as ZZZZ.
